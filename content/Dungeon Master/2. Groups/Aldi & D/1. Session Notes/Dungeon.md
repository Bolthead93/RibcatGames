**Ambience.** The caverns are damp, humid, and full of life. Stalactites drip into shallow puddles, and water trickles down the slick cave walls. The sounds of cave bats, small insects, and the caverns’ monstrous denizens echo throughout.

**Ceilings.** Ceilings are 15 feet high in corridors and tunnels and 20 feet high in chambers.

**Lighting.** The caverns are unlit. Denizens carry their own light or rely on [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.

**Underground Rivers.** The rivers that span the lesser caverns have strong currents. A creature that enters a river for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swept 20 feet in the direction indicated by the arrows on the map.
