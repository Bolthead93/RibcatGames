- gets seasick easily
Personal Quest

	Disillusioned with the corruption of Neverwinter, the paladin comes to Dragon’s Rest seeking rest and new resolve. Runara welcomes the character and encourages them to talk to Tarak and Varnoth, who both know about escaping lives of corruption and violence. She also encourages the paladin to spend time in the temple of Bahamut. At the end of the adventure, she asks the paladin if they have learned anything about how to live in a world plagued with such corruption. If the character has no answer, she suggests, “Perhaps your adventures here have shown you a way to combat evil on your own terms. Perhaps other such adventures await you.”

# Nevae

Personal Quest

	The rogue comes to Dragon’s Rest in search of a lost fortune supposedly secreted away on the island by a member of the Gilded Gallows. The thieves’ guild member in question is Tarak, who did in fact betray the guild, though the story has been twisted in the retelling. Tarak’s last assignment for the guild was to assassinate a traitor, who was his lover. The two tried to flee Elturgard together, but his lover was killed by another assassin. Tarak escaped, but no treasure was involved. If the rogue asks him about it, he explains he has left the life of crime—and suggests perhaps it’s time for the rogue to do the same.
