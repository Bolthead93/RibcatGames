# Notes

magic rock that says lessgoo in sniz pocket

stopped at the springs and fought some fume drakes, drank that water
picked some shrooms, communicated with thorgal
sus holes, plugged with mushrooms, started digging away
shoved lessgos head in to the holes, heard some chanting

dawkins did some library down time
lessgo train the chicken to get +2 more hit
cass did flips down the dragons rest and earnt 30 gold
thorgal did mushroom things

went back to cave to meet mushroom mod thorgal, heard the chanting during his trance
sent chicken down the hole, saw some bodies of gnomes

went outside and found a way to the smokey holes, roped down
dawking winged down, cass did a cool fall
lessgo fell, thorgal full speed down
