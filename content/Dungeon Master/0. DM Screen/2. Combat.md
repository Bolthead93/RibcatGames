# Exhaustion

## Exhaustion Levels

|Level|Effect|
|---|:--|
|1|Disadvantage on ability checks.|
|2|Speed halved|
|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|4|Hit point maximum halved|
|5|Speed reduced to 0|
|6|Death|

  

## Suffering Exhaustion

|Cause|Details|
|:--|:--|
|Forced March|For each hour spent traveling past 8 hours make a CON save at DC 10 + 1 for each hour past 8. On a failed save, a character suffers 1 level of exhaustion.|
|Starvation|If a creature doesn't eat enough food in a day, they start to starve. Food can be stretched out by eating half as much per day, which counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON mod, and then at the end of each day beyond that a character automatically suffers 1 level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating reduces the days without food to 0.|
|Dehydration|A creature who drinks less than half as much water than they need in a day must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers 1 level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If a character already has any levels of exhaustion, they gain 2 levels in either case.|
|Barbarian's Frenzy|A Barbarian who goes down the Path of the Berserker can choose to enter a frenzy if he is raging. When the rage ends, he suffers a level of exhaustion.|

  

## Reducing Levels of Exhaustion

At the end of a long rest, provided a character has had enough food and water that day, they reduce their level of exhaustion by 1.

# The Rules of Stealth

When attempting to hide, there are 4 simple rules to remember.

  

1. If someone can see you, you can't attempt to hide from them.
2. Someone doesn't see you when they're not looking at you.
3. Once hidden, you can be detected via sight, hearing, or both, so don't be seen or heard. If their perception check or passive perception is higher than your stealth roll, they detect you.
4. You can hide in plain sight, given a moment of being unseen or unattended and an appropriate concealment strategy

If you are hidden, or when someone can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against them, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you make an attack while hidden, regardless of whether it hits or misses, you are no longer hidden.  

# Grappling, Shoving, and Climbing onto Bigger Creatures

When you take the [attack action](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#attackaction) you can use one attack to grapple, shove, or climb onto an enemy.  

## Grappling

You can grab a creature which is no more than one size category higher than you. Using at least one free hand, you make an Athletics check contested by the target's Athletics or Acrobatics check. If you succeed, the target is now [grappled](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#grappled) by you. You can also grapple an enemy to climb on top of it.

### Escaping a grapple.

While grappled, a creature can use its action to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check opposed by your Athletics check. If the creature succeeds, it moves to a space next to you.

### Moving a grappled creature.

When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

## Shoving

Using the attack action, you can attempt to shove a creature no more than one size larger than you. You make an Athletics check opposed by its Athletics or Acrobatics check. If you succeed you either move it 5 feet in any direction or knock it [prone](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#prone).

## Climbing onto Bigger Creatures

A suitably large creature can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. Once you make any ability checks necessary to get into position and to get onto the bigger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make an Athletics or Acrobatics check contested by the targets Acrobatics check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space and clings to his body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

    The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature may or may not be able to attack the smaller creature, depending on the smaller creature's location, this is up to the DM. The larger creature can try to dislodge the creature as an action - shaking it off, scraping it against a wall, grabbing and throwing it off - by making an Athletics check opposed by the smaller creature's Athletics or Acrobatics check.

  

# Readying an Action

As an action on your turn, you can take the Ready action so that you may act later in the round using your reaction. To do this, you need to clearly define 2 things.

    First, you must decide what circumstances will trigger your prepared action. For example, you could say that the trigger is "A hostile creature comes through the door in front of me".

    Second, you must decide what you will do if the triggering event happens. You may take an [action](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#combatactions) such as the [attack action](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#attackaction) or you may move up to your speed. For example, you could say "I will attack with my greatsword".

When you put both the trigger and the action together you get a coherent sentence. The example is "If a hostile creature comes through the door in front of me, I will attack with my greatsword".

### Readying A Spell.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you then release with your reaction. To be readied a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires [concentration](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#concentration). If your concentration is broken the spell dissipates.

  

# Dropping to 0 Hit Points

## Death Saving Throws

When you start your turn at 0 hit points, you need to make a death saving throw. Rolling 9 and below counts as a failure, and 10 and above counts as a success. If you accrue 3 failures before 3 successes, you die. If you accrue 3 successes, you are stabilized. If you regain any hit points, both your successes and failures are reset.

### Rolling 1 or 20.

When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

### Damage at 0 Hit Points.

If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall [unconscious](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#unconscious). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw. You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Medicine check. A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
