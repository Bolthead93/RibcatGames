# Strength

_Strength measures bodily power and athletic training._
- Attempting to climb a cliff
- Clinging on to a surface while something is trying to knock you off
- Jumping longer than normal distances, or stunting mid jump
- Fighting against strong currents or something trying to pull you underwater

|Strength|Used For...|Rule|
|---|:-:|:--|
|Score|Determines modifier|Refer to [this](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#abilitymodifiers) chart|
||Carrying Capacity|Strength score times 15 in pounds1|
||Push, Drag, or Lift|Up to 2 times carrying capacity2|
|Modifier|Determines bonus to strength related rolls|Refer to [this](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#abilitymodifiers) chart|
|Save|Opposing a force that would physically move or bind you|1d20 + STR mod + Proficiency (if proficient)|
|Strength Check|Any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.|1d20 + STR mod|
||Breaking Manacles|DC 20 check|
||Breaking Rope|DC 17 check|
|Other possible uses|Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door. Push through a tunnel that is too small. Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it. Tip over a statue. Keep a builder from rolling.||

1 For each size category above medium, double the creatures carrying capacity and the amount it can pull, drag, or lift. For a tiny creature, half these weights. 2 While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

## Strength Skills

_Below are all the skills associated with the Strength ability._

| Athletics |  |
| :--: | :--: |
| Automatic | Climb a wall with plenty of handholds or a secure, knotted rope or rope ladder; swim in relatively calm water; jump a number of feet horizontally equal to half of your Strength score, or your full Strength score with a 10 foot running start; leap into the air a number of feet equal to half of (3 + your Strength modifier), or the full amount with a 10 foot running start 1 2 |
| Easy | Climb a wall lacking an adequate amount of handholds, tread water in rough conditions, jump a few feet farther than you normally could; during a long jump, clear an obstacle such as a low-lying hedge or wall of height ≤a fourth of the jump's distance |
| Moderate | Climb a rope dangling from a protrusion or overhang (i.e. lacking a vertical surface to brace against), swim in rough water or against a mild current |
| Hard | Climb a wall with very few handholds, catch yourself on a rope or other handhold in the middle or at the end of your jump, swim in violent water or against a strong current |
| Very Hard | Climb a slippery or sheer wall with little or no handholds, climb vertically along an overhang with adequate handholds, swim in stormy waters |
|  |  |
| **Feats of Strength - Other** |  |
|  |  |
| Easy | Force open a stuck or broken door, break free from weak bindings, pull a stuck or wedged object loose |
| Moderate | Break through a wooden door reinforced with iron, hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it |
| Hard | Break through a heavy locked or barred door, topple a stone statue |
| Very Hard | Break through a heavy, reinforced door such as a prison or armory door, hold a door shut against a room filling with water |

1 A PC can climb and swim under normal conditions without having to make a check; however, strenuous conditions may require that they pass an Athletics check. Each foot of movement during such a check costs an extra foot of movement, or an extra 2 feet if it is considered difficult terrain. Characters with climb and swim speeds ignore the extra costs associated with movement of this type. Similarly, the horizontal and vertical distance a PC can jump without having to make a check is determined by their Strength score and modifier respectively. An Athletics check is generally only required when attempting to jump a distance farther than the amount calculate in the table above.  
2 During a vertical jump a PC can extend their arms in order to achieve an extra distance equal to 1⁄2 of their height, which they can effectively add to their jump distance in order to attempt to grab on to a ledge or other handhold.

| Moderate | A PC drinking more than half the amount of water they require during the day but less than the full amount must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or advance one level of [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion), or two levels if they are already suffering from [exhaustion](https://ceryliae.github.io/5edmscreen/#exhaustion). |

1 Constitution represents a largely passive set of 'skills' which have more to do with enduring than performing a specific action the PC can become proficient in. Therefore, Constitution checks are more uncommon than other ability checks and are usually made without adding a proficiency bonus, although situational bonuses may still apply.  
NOTE: An ability check is different from a saving throw; players can be proficient at Constitution saving throws.  
2 A PC can only travel for eight hours a day before they risk becoming exhausted.  
3 A PC requires one gallon of water per day, or two if the climate is harsh.
