# Tips for Myself

Put things to find (items, lore, knowledge) in each explorable area of the map

Plan for what will happen if the players do nothing

Get players to input when somebody asks a question, help bring everyone in to the worldbuilding

Read the campaign and fill out characters, locations and encounters from that.

Fill out environments with hints towards objectives, or encounters, such as players are travelling in the wilderness and spot some tracks with passive perception, maybe someone investigates, owlbear tracks. It hints towards possible encounters, or gives them incentive to go explore for an owlbear cave.

Create a playground for the character, don't write a plot.
