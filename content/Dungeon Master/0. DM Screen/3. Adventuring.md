1 First and second level spellscasting services are easy enough to find in a decently sized city or town.  
2 Third level and higher spells are much more rare and can only be found with any amount of regularity in a large city, perhaps home to a University or Temple.  
3 Often times a spellcaster might ask for a service rather than monetary payment.

## Weapon Properties

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Ammunition|You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.|
|Finesse|When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.|
|Heavy|Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.|
|Light|A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.|
|Loading|Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.|
|Range|A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.|
|Reach|This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it.|
|Special|A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).|
|(Lance)|You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.|
|(Net)|A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.|
|Thrown|If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.|
|Two-Handed|This weapon requires two hands to use.|
|Versatile|This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.|

# Resting

**Short Rest:**

- A period of downtime lasting at least one hour, during which time you can do nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, or tending to wounds.
- You regain the use of abilities, features, and resources that are refreshed by taking a Short Rest.
- You are allowed to expend one of your accumulated Hit Die by rolling a die of the corresponding type. You regain hit points equal to the rolled value + your Constitution modifier. Afterwards, you may choose to spend another Hit Die.

**Full Text:**

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous that eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Dice spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

**Long Rest:**

- A period of extended downtime lasting at least eight hours, during which time you must either sleep or perform only light activities such as talking, eating, or standing watch. These activities can occupy no more than 2 hours of your Long Rest. Performing more than an hour of strenuous activity such as walking or fighting will also interrupt your Long Rest. You may only benefit from one Long Rest in a 24-hour period and you must begin the rest with at least one hit point.
- You regain the use of abilities, features, and resources that are refreshed by a long rest
- You regain all of your lost hit points unless otherwise indicated.
- You regain a number of Hit Die equal to up half of your total possible Hit Die.

**Full Text:**

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest in interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of waking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity - the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them. For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

# Foraging

|### Foraging DCs|   |
|:--|:--|
|Food and Water Availbality|Survival DC|
|Abundant food and water|10|
|Limited food and water sources|15|
|Very little, if any, food and water souurces|20|

  

If multiple charactes forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failure. On a successful check, roll 1d6 + wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) and water (in galloons) the character finds. Make a separate roll for food and water.

# Tying Knots

- The creature tying the knot makes an **Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check**
- The total of the check equals the DC to untie the knot with another **Intelligence (Sleight of Hand)** check or to slip out of the knot with an Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
